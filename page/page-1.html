            I have been in the technology field for a number of years. I began my career as a developer. Over the years, my role
            transitioned from developer to technical lead to project manager to director of engineering. I've been involved in several areas of the product delivery process.
            I written business requirements, maintain applications, built applications, developed quality assurance scripts.
            I've been responsible for many systems including corporate applications to custom built applications.
            I  enjoy solving problems. In the last 3-4 years, I've have the opportunity to code again.
            My goal is to have a more hands-on role with my team.

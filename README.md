## My Portfolio

I am not very good working on the front-end of an application. Maybe because I enjoy the backend, writing logic, more than I do working on the front-end. Honestly, writing front-end code can be frustrating for me. When I make a small change sometimes my entire page is affected. 


Also, I am not really looking to change jobs. My goal for this bootcamp is to learn more about technologies. I want to become a more hands-on manager and I felt that taking a class would force me to be discipline in respects to continuing to learn the different technologies.

## My Strategy for My Portfolio 

1. As mentioned earlier, I am not very good nor do I enjoy writing code for the front-end. So, I took the advice provided in the homework instructions and retrieved a template to use for my project. 
2. I customized the template to fit my experiences, assignments/projects, etc.
3. I updated my gitHub repos' read me files.
4. I attempted to create a resume. I hate to admit but I have not had a resume for a while and have not kept one up to date, so this was a challenge for me.
